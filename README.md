# Morse-Code-App
This app is meant to show how we can have different pages within an app. The main features of this app are the up button and the intent function.

The up button lets the user go back to the parent activity while the intent function allows the user to go to the next activity screen and send and receive messages. 
The Send screen has a placeholder for the "transmit button" but is supposed to have a functioning "Lookup button" that leads to the Look Up Activity where the user can see Morse code translations. If they click on any of the codes, the app will send it back to Send Activity and hold that for them there.
