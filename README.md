# Morse-Code-App
This app is meant to show how we can have different pages within an app. The main features of this app are the up button and the intent function.

 used an original code that was on Zybooks, where it shows a step-by-step tutorial on how to get the functions to work. The app uses GGC colors, a GGC building, and has a Floating Action Button with a calculator icon. I also changed the launcher icon from the traditional android icon to a pizza one. The last thing I did was to create a log statement that informs the user when their calculation is complete with the statement, “Your Calculation is Complete!”
